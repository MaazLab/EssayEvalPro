Me and my friends, we was goin' to the park yesterdy. We seen a lots of birds flyin' in the sky. It were so beautiful. Then, we start playin' football and I kicked the ball so high, it almost hitted the tree. Everybody was laughin' so hard. After that, we eated ice cream and it tasted so good. We had a great time. When it got dark, we went back to our home. It was a fun day and I can't wait to do it again!
