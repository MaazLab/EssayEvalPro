# EssayEvalPro: Advanced Essay Evaluation System

## Overview
The EssayEvalPro is a system designed specifically for teachers to assist them in evaluating essays submitted by their students. The system leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to provide a comprehensive analysis of each essay, including plagiarism detection, relevancy assessment, and grammar error identification.

## Features
* **Plagiarism Detection:** The system compares the submitted essay with a database of existing essays to determine the extent of similarity and identify potential instances of plagiarism.
* **Relevancy Calculation:** By utilizing NLP techniques, the system calculates the relevancy of the essay based on its title, allowing teachers to assess how well the content aligns with the chosen topic.
* **Grammar Mistake Analysis:** The system employs NLP capabilities to analyze the essay and highlight any grammar mistakes or errors, helping students improve their writing skills.
* **Score Generation:** After evaluating the essay for plagiarism, relevancy, and grammar mistakes, the system generates a score that reflects the overall quality and originality of the submitted work.
## How It Works
1. **Plagiarism Detection:** When an essay is submitted, the system compares it against the existing essays in its database using NLP techniques. It calculates the degree of similarity and identifies any instances of potential plagiarism.
2. **Relevancy Calculation:** The system then uses NLP methods to evaluate the relevancy of the essay by analyzing the title and its alignment with the content. This analysis helps teachers assess the coherence and suitability of the essay's topic.
3. **Grammar Mistake Analysis:** Next, the system employs NLP tools to identify and highlight grammar mistakes and errors within the essay, providing valuable feedback to students for improvement.
4. **Score Generation:** Based on the results obtained from the plagiarism detection, relevancy calculation, and grammar mistake analysis, the system generates a comprehensive score that reflects the quality and originality of the essay. This score assists teachers in objectively assessing and providing feedback to the students.
